CS 506 Group Project in a Agile/Scrum setting. We performed weekly scrums, two code reviews, and had three three week sprints. 

This is a full stack web application developed used the FARM stack. (FastAPI, React.js, MongoDB). It allows you to create an account, then search for a gym partner at the University of Wisconsin. 

I was on the backend side of development. I developed and organized the API, as well as helped integrate GCP into our API.
